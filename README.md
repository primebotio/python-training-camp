### Instructions on uploading your solutions
First, clone this repository to your personal computer. Then, after solving and **evaluating** your solutions using [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), create and upload a separate branch for each problem. Please **use python 3** to solve the above  challanges.

*Hint :*  Make sure to upload your progress on a regular basis. You can make several commits to denote your progress. For instance, if you have a solution to a problem that is not passing all the test cases, you can upload the existing one and continue working on it at a later point.
